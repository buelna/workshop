<h1>Scope</h1>
<p align="justify"> 
The advances in computing, communications and sensing technologies have allowed the development of eHealth and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) services to mainly benefit the elderly and individuals with disabilities. These services are a helpful tool to address the inherent problems of the aging societies. Among the enabling technologies of eHealth and ALL services, we have wireless sensor networks, the Internet of Things, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, just to name a few.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The development of eHealth and Ambient Assisted Living services requires the seamless integration of computing and communication technologies, and the use of efficient algorithms and platforms. In addition, these services may also enforce the use of new approaches and paradigms for ubiquitous computing and closed-loop solutions.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The main objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers from both academia and industry, to discuss current problems that face the development of the future eHealth and AAL services. We encourage the participation of researchers from the sensing network, Big Data, Internet of Things, Cyber-physical Systems, ubiquitous computing, and signal processing communities, among others, to submit contributions to the workshop.
