<h1>Scope</h1>
<p align="justify"> 
The advances in computing, communications and sensing technologies have 
allowed the development of eHealth and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) services to 
mainly benefit the elderly and individuals with disabilities. These services are a 
helpful tool to address the inherent problems of the aging societies. Among the 
enabling technologies of eHealth and ALL services, we have wireless sensor 
networks, the Internet of Things, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, 
just to name a few.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The development of eHealth and Ambient Assisted Living services requires the 
seamless integration of computing and communication technologies, and the use of 
efficient algorithms and platforms. In addition, these services may also enforce the 
use of new approaches and paradigms for ubiquitous computing and closed-loop 
solutions.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The main objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers from 
both academia and industry, to discuss current problems that face the 
development of the future eHealth and AAL services. We encourage the 
participation of researchers from the sensing network, Internet of Things, Cyber-
physical, ubiquitous computing, and signal processing communities, among others, 
to submit contributions to the workshop.
